# A User style is a theme

This is a dark theme for the [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com) website. This custom userstyle follows [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS) guidelines. A custom userstyle allows additional website styling to overlay its default. This is made possible by userstyle extensions for browsers.

Like many others, I use goodreads to track my books read and progress. I got tired of staring out their bright off-white website all the time. Search results for *goodreads dark themes* and/or user styles you'll find a few, but most are broken and out of date.

## Goodreads is huge

This ended up being a much larger project than I originally thought. By far the largest and hardest dark theme I have tackled thus far. 

## Colors, enter Jade City

I finished Fonda Lee's [Jade City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34606064-jade-city) in November and it left an impact when I initially started this project. The goodreads default link color is `hsl(176, 100%, 19%)`. A green that instantly made me think of *Jade City*.

The final *jade* color palette I came up with is below. These are all the greens used throughout the dark theme. Some examples are links, buttons, hover effects, text highlights, accent borders, progress bars, & more.

I'll update the post with the background color palette as well.

## Other changes

I took some liberties with some aesthetics. My goal was to reduce clutter and overall busyness.

- Removed **so many borders**!
- Increased padding here and there.
- Increased border radius here and there for more inviting feel.
