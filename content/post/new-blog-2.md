 * [Steal Like an Artist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13099738-steal-like-an-artist) by Austin Kleon
 * [Show Your Work!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work) by Austin Kleon

 Just finishing up the last one and I must say [Austin](https://austinkleon.com) makes some great points! He inspired me to not only create this blog, which also furthered my knowledge and understanding at the same time. Thanks dude.
