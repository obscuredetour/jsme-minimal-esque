## My New Blog

I decided on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for some reason. Perhaps it's because I named a puppy Hugo many years ago. I likely forgot the real reason.

Anywho, this is namely a test post, but I sure hope Hugo is still doing well.

## Recent books

These are in no particular order. Each have inspired and entertained.

 * [Red Sister](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister) by Mark Lawrence.
 
 My first Mark Lawrence novel. He blew me away! What a good one.

 * [Steal Like an Artist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13099738-steal-like-an-artist) by Austin Kleon
 * [Show Your Work!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work) by Austin Kleon

 Just finishing up the last one and I must say [Austin](https://austinkleon.com) makes some great points! He inspired me to not only create this blog, which also furthered my knowledge and understanding at the same time. Thanks dude.
